  <h2>👨‍💻 About Toshon Jennings</h2>
  <p>
    I'm an IT professional, cockpit architect, and product steward driven by clarity, transparency, and trust-centered design. I manage multi-campus educational infrastructure by day, build verification tooling by night—and refine everything in between.
  </p>

  <h3>🛠️ Current Role</h3>
  <p>
    I serve as I.T. Coordinator at The City School (Philadelphia), leading incident response, asset management, and infrastructure modernization. I oversee key IT projects—including MSSP transitions, E-Rate implementations, and process documentation—while optimizing service delivery, user satisfaction, and operational uptime across multiple campuses.
  </p>

  <h3>📦 Creator of CAps</h3>
  <p>
    CAps is a portable, trust-forward verification tool I designed to help users confirm file authenticity, detect tampering, and validate digital signatures. It’s the centerpiece of my GitHub cockpit, built with AutoHotkey and distributed through a fully auditable trust pipeline.
  </p>
  <p>
    The CAps cockpit showcases not just technical implementation, but visual design, documentation polish, favicon hygiene, anchor consistency, and user empowerment—hallmarks of my product stewardship philosophy.

  <h3>📚 Tools & Philosophy</h3>
  <p>
    I work fluently across scripting (PowerShell, Bash, AutoHotkey), front-end design (HTML, CSS, UI/UX), and user trust tooling (GPG, hashes, OpenTimestamp). My cockpit tooling reflects a commitment to parity, transparency, and future-proof design.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also support educational programs—training tech learners, facilitating chess clubs, and mentoring next-gen problem solvers.
