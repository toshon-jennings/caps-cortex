# 🧠 caps-cortex  
Copilot-assisted staging, drafting, and development for Double Caps Correct ("CAps")

---

## 🧩 What Is This Repo?  
A trusted workspace for thinking out loud—with structure.  
**caps-cortex** is a companion repo to your main CAps GitHub Pages site. It houses markdown-based lists, drafts, and logs for collaborative development with Microsoft Copilot (primarily), and GitHUb Copilot (secondarily).

This is where ideas mature before going live.

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
- Maintain a **live Do Now List** and **Future List** via `copilot-sync.md`  
- Draft **FAQ entries**, onboarding blurbs, and footer snippets  
- Log development milestones in `project-log.md`  
- Keep **user-facing repos clean** by staging updates here first  

---

## 🤝 Collaboration Philosophy  
- Copilot helps with formatting, sequencing, and versioning—not direct commits  
- All updates here are manual → you decide what gets promoted  
- Timestamping, emoji hierarchy, and concise notes ensure clarity at every step  

---

## 📄 Contents  
- `copilot-sync.md` – Dynamic task lists, FAQ drafts, footers, etc.  
- `project-log.md` – Narrative dev history starting July 20, 2025  
- _(Optional additions)_ style guides, onboarding copy, UX experiment logs  

---

## 🔒 Why Keep This Separate?  
- Avoid cluttering the public CAps repo with staging logic  
- Maintain total control over what gets published  
- Enable frictionless ideation and iteration with Copilot  

---

## ✨ Future Directions  
- Mirror finalized FAQs to CAps homepage  
- Publish cleaned YAML task lists to CAps Wiki  
- Explore GitHub Actions to lint, timestamp, or validate staging syntax
